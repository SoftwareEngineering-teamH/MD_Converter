<h2>Features</h2>
<br>
<ul><li>Build useful web applications with only a few lines of code&amp;mdash;no JavaScript required.</li><li>Shiny applications are automatically "live" in the same way that spreadsheets are live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser.</li><li>Shiny user interfaces can be built entirely using R, or can be written directly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for more flexibility.</li><li>Works in any R environment (Console R, Rgui for Windows or Mac, ESS, StatET, RStudio, etc.).</li><li>Attractive default UI theme based on</li><li>A highly customizable slider widget with built-in support for animation.</li><li>Pre-built output widgets for displaying plots, tables, and printed output of R objects.</li><li>Fast bidirectional communication between the web browser and R using the package.</li><li>Uses a programming model that eliminates messy event handling code, so you can focus on the code that really matters.</li><li>Develop and redistribute your own Shiny widgets that other developers can easily drop into their own applications (coming soon!).</li></ul>
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<br>
To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:<br>
<br>
```r<br>
install.packages("shiny")<br>
```<br>
<br>
To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run this instead:<br>
<br>
```r<br>
if (!require("devtools"))<br>
  install.packages("devtools")<br>
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shiny")<br>
```<br>
<br>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<br>
To learn more we highly recommend you check out the <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/">Shiny Tutorial</a>. The tutorial explains the framework in-depth, walks you through building a simple application, and includes extensive annotated examples.<br>

<h2>Bootstrap 3 migration</h2>
<br>
Shiny versions 0.10.2.2 and below used the Bootstrap 2 web framework. After 0.10.2.2, Shiny switched to Bootstrap 3. For most users, the upgrade should be seamless. However, if you have have customized your HTML-generating code to use features specific to Bootstrap 2, you may need to update your code to work with Bootstrap 3.<br>
<br>
If you do not wish to update your code at this time, you can use the  package for backward compatibility.<br>
<br>
If you prefer to install an older version of Shiny, you can do it using the devtools package:<br>
<br>
```R<br>
devtools::install_version("shiny", version = "0.10.2.2")<br>
```<br>
<br>
<h2>Development notes</h2>
<br>
The Javascript code in Shiny is minified using tools that run on Node.js. See the tools/ directory for more information.<br>
